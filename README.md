# ðŸ“ˆ (Dataset Available) -- ChatGPT Informed Graph Neural Network for Stock Movement Prediction ðŸ“ˆ

- This repository houses the datasets/resources used in our paper [ChatGPT Informed Graph Neural Network for Stock Movement Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03763). 
- This research introduces a novel framework that leverages ChatGPT's graph inference capabilities to enhance Graph Neural Networks (GNN).
- Our model shows superior performance in both (1) stock movement prediction and (2) portfolio construction.
- Dive in to find the datasets, code samples, and more!

## ðŸš€ Get Started

The data can be found in the Data folder, which contains two files:

- `ticker_train_data.json`: This file holds the data utilized for training and validation of our model.
- `ticker_test_data.json`: This file contains the data used for model evaluation.

To load the data, you can start with 4 lines of code:
```
import pandas as pd
import json

train_data = pd.read_json('./Data/ticker_train_data.json')
test_data = pd.read_json('./Data/ticker_test_data.json')
```

The `Affected Companies` column provides two key insights:

- Companies that ChatGPT predicts will be influenced by the financial news.
- The sentiment indicating the nature of the impact on these companies (e.g., positive or negative).
